This is a Human Chat Simulator. The Code is mostly written in Java and AIML(Artificial Intelligent Markup Language).

The ChatBot can be made more smarter by adding more AIML Files. Please add more such files to make the Bot more smarter and so that it can answer more questions.

The Important Tags for AIML are given below :
 1. <aiml> : Parent Tag to start and end the AIML Document.
 2. <category> : Every new question or pattern with its relevant answer goes in this Tag.
 3. <pattern> : Matches the Pattern of the User's Question e.g. What is your Name ?
 4. <template> : The Bot gives the answer from here if the Answer is matched. e.g. My Name is Jarvis. 
 
 Most of the Source Code is taken from a site called A.L.I.C.E.(Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity) bot.
 Here's the Link to read more about AIML Files and download Source Code :-

 Will be adding more information as I progress with this Project.
